    <p class="content" >To learn something and especially something which you never heard  of can be an intimidating task. But 
        I am going to share what works for me and might help someone as well in their learning journey.
        
        So the very first step is RESEARCH. And you know who is going to be your companion in this. Yes, you thought it right-our very own Google uncle. So let's say you want to learn some "xyz" skill. 
        You will go on Google and simply search "How do I learn  xyz".Yes, it's that simple. You will get tons of links and just go through them all to get a basic idea what all is required from you to learn. <br>
          
        Second step is YouTube.
        Watch some videos and get a even more clear perspective as you already have some awareness and pre-knowledge from your research on Google.
        Now you are aware of the skill completely. And getting aware makes 50% of the task done!<br>
        Now comes the next step which is strategy which is going to help you achieve and which you are going to follow:
        To make strategy you can take some advice and help from people who are already working and well-versed in the same domain. Because their experience would teach you a lot . After deciding the strategy and doing planning for implement  , consistently, I repeat consistently work on that. It's not about the hard work , it's a consistency game. The sooner you understand this the better you'll be at your work. And set short deadlines for yourself .Why?

        THE SAME APPLIES TO YOUR GOALS, AMBITIONS, AND PLANS."-Elon Musk<br>
        
        Keep a check on your progress and voila after few months of practice, grind and dedication you have become a master of that skill :D
