    <p class="content" >I started my journey back in September 2020, when i got admission in MCA programme at IGDTUW.Since then i am
        trying to learn skills but that process of getting aware and learning new things becomes overwhelming.Since
        then , I think I have watched so many tutorials on web development but never tried things on my own.But a few
        days
        back i got to know anout neog camp and I decided to complete level 0 .Now,things are changing as I am completing
        every task assigned in level 0.And I have already started to feel that now the real learning has begun.Uptil now, i have learned HTML,CSS, how Git and Github works,made two CLI apps
        and now looking forward to move ahead in the journey by not getting overwhelmed rather enjoying the journey more than the destination.It feels really great that I am in a field which is full of learning and growth. And with my hardwork and will to learn ,I am sure I'll be able to do justice with the kind of resources (eg. NeoG) we have available in this time and age and make myself as better as I can.
